Error in Numerical Integration

The value I got for tmin was 10,423,000


The amount of time it took the program to run was about 30 seconds to a minute for each time I
ran it since I was narrowing down on the problem. If I had ran it starting t at 0 and then
incremented by 10,000 like I did on my final integration then it would've taken much longer.


I started off by just passing it a n to see how far off it was. For instance I wouldn't try 
to calulate it based off of the absolute relative error; instead I would pass in a small number
and then a large number to get an idea of how big of a number I should have.

By just passing in random values I was able to get the general Idea which is what lead me to the idea of just going through values until I got the right number.

Then to calcluate a more precise number once I had an idea of what range it sould be in I did
a do while loop until the current calulated error was less then the absolute error. During each
itteration of the loop I would increment by 1,000,000. Then once I got 11,000,000 for t I
incremented by 100,000 each time and passed in 9,000,000 as the starting value.

When I incremented by 100,000 I got the value 10,600,000 so I then incremented by 10,000 from 
10,400,000 and got the value 10,450,000. Something strace about this itteration was that I got
the following errrors:

T VALUE              ERROR
_______              _____
10410000.000000      0.0000000000000050471
10420000.000000      0.0000000000000051098
10430000.000000      0.0000000000000050285
10440000.000000      0.0000000000000050792
10450000.000000      0.0000000000000049733

As you can see the error values go up and then back down which I found very strange

Then I ran it for a final time incrementing by 1,000 stating at 10,420,000 aftet this run I got
10,423,000 for t

Once again my error was kinda funny:

T VALUE              ERROR
_______              _____
10421000.000000      0.0000000000000050752
10422000.000000      0.0000000000000050938
10423000.000000      0.0000000000000049867

After I did all of this I thought I should make it automatically make it change the
amount that it increments by so that I can find the best value for t down to the
ones place

I added some conditions to my loop and now my t value is 10,500,411 which is different
from before but vary similar.

What I thought was funny about this was that when I reverted to my old code and ran
it I got 10,423,000 for my t value again. Anyway just thought this was interesting.
